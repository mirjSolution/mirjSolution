Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated with a degree of BS in Computer Science back in Philippines, and now currently living here in Canada as a new immigrant.

I have an experienced as a Programmer in Philippines, but that is so very long time ago, I am a student right now at CarrerFoundry Full Stack Web Development Immersion Bootcamp to upgrade my skills.
