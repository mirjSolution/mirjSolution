## 🚀 About Me

With a background in computer science and certifications in AWS, CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+, I’ve reignited my IT career through hands-on labs, a full-stack web bootcamp, and now — diving deep into DevOps.

I’m building my way forward:
- One command line at a time  
- One virtual machine at a time  
- One pipeline, container, and cloud server at a time

I don’t have a traditional path, but I have:
- Grit  
- Discipline  
- Consistency  
- And a willingness to learn every single day

I’m not just learning DevOps — **I’m proving what’s possible when you don’t quit.**
