Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated with a degree of BS in Computer Science and worked for 3 years as a programmer back in Philippines. I am a new immigrant here in Canada and currently enrolled on a professional certification at CareerFoundry taking up the Full Stack Web Development Immersion Bootcamp. To upgrade my skills.
