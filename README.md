Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated with a BS in Computer Science back in the Philippines. I am currently living in Canada as a new immigrant.
I have work for 3 years as a programmer back in the Philippines, but it was some time ago. Now, I am a student at CarrerFoundryâ€™s Full Stack Web Development Immersion to upgrade my skills.
