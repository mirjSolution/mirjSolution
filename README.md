Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Rico, a Web Developer. I worked as an I.T. support/programmer in a telephone company where I handled troubleshooting and developed desktop applications that helped employees work more efficiently. 

I was also a part of the Hospitality industry for 14 years. My experience in technology came in hand, when I developed a desktop application as a side project. I worked collaboratively with managers in building a presentation to use for training staff in maintaining the five-star quality of the services we offer. 

The skills gained in the hotel and telephone industry came in useful as a web developer.

I found my spark in building websites and look forward to sharing my skills, experiences, and abilities to create remarkable web pages.
